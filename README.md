# sales-eda-analysis
Exploratory data analysis of sales data

Project Overview
This project explores a retail sales dataset to analyse regional performance, category trends, time‑based patterns, and top‑selling products. The aim is to demonstrate a complete exploratory data analysis (EDA) workflow using Python, with a strong focus on business‑relevant metrics and clear, interpretable insights.
The analysis mirrors real‑world retail and business analytics use cases, including revenue concentration, customer purchasing behaviour, and seasonality.

Objectives
The primary objectives of this analysis were to:
- Compare sales performance across geographic regions
- Measure transaction volume versus revenue contribution
- Analyse category‑level revenue drivers
- Identify temporal trends by month and day of week
- Highlight top‑performing products
- Translate raw transactional data into actionable insights

Dataset
Type: Retail transaction data
Granularity: Individual sales transactions
Key fields:
Order ID
Order Date
Region
Category
Product Name
Sales
The dataset represents individual purchase events, allowing analysis at regional, category, product, and temporal levels.

Analysis Workflow
1)  Regional Performance
Regional sales performance was assessed using:
Total sales revenue
Number of unique transactions
Average sale value
Average Order Value (AOV), calculated as:
AOV = total_sales / number_of_transactions

This distinction helps identify regions driven by:
High transaction volume versus
Higher‑value orders per transaction

2) Category Performance
Each product category was evaluated based on:
Total sales
Number of transactions
Average sale value
This highlights which categories are the largest contributors to revenue and whether performance is driven by volume or order size.

3)  Time‑Based Analysis
Temporal patterns were explored by analysing:
Monthly sales trends to identify seasonality
Day‑of‑week performance to understand purchasing behaviour across the week
Order dates were converted to datetime format to ensure accurate grouping and chronological ordering.

4) Product Performance
Products were ranked by total sales to identify the top 10 revenue‑generating products, showing:
Revenue concentration
Key products driving overall performance

Key Insights: 
- The West is the region that consistently leads in total sales, indicating strong overall market prescence. The west also records the highest transaction count, suggesting high customer activity even where average sale values are lower.
- The category, technology contributes a disproprotionate share of total revenue.
- There are clear seasonal patterns, with November showing peak sales performance.
- Sales vary meaningfully by day of week, with Saturday leading in terms of sales. This reveals opportunities for promotions and operational optimsiation.
- The product, Canon imageClass 220 0 Advanced Copier generates the most sales.

Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation and aggregation
- Datetime utilities for temporal analysis
- Jupyter Notebook / Python scripts for reproducible workflows

Limitations
- The analysis is descriptive and does not infer causality
- Customer demographic information is not available
- Promotional, pricing, or discount data is not included
-Results depend on the accuracy and completeness of the dataset

Possible Extensions
- Customer segmentation analysis
- Sales forecasting and trend modelling
- Category growth analysis over time
- Promotion impact modelling
- SQL‑based data modelling and dashboards

Author Notes
This project forms part of a structured data analytics portfolio aimed at demonstrating:
- End‑to‑end exploratory analysis
- Business‑focused metric selection
- Clear communication of findings
- Reproducible analytical workflows

The emphasis is on clarity, decision relevance, and analytical judgement rather than unnecessary technical complexity.
